    <h1>Using Python better</h1>
    <p>
      In the previous chapter we briefly talked about the internal (built-in) objects of Python and their functions.
      In this chapter we dive deeper into these objects and talk more about the functions from these objects.
    </p>
    <img src="../../../images/learn_python/chapter5/RealPython.png" width="60%" class="image">
    <p>
      We are going to do some <i>data processing</i> at the end of this chapter.
      This means that you will write functions that receive some data, from their input arguments,
      and produce some output, which they will return.
      For that reason, we start with learning more about Python functions and their input arguments.
    </p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>
      We learned about the functions earlier in Chapter 2.
      Remember that functions <i>could</i> receive inputs and return outputs.
      For example
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Simple functions

def subtract(a, b):
  # This is a simple function that subtracts two numbers
  return a - b

# This is how we use this function.
answer = subtract(8, 5)
print(answer)
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      3
    </div>

    <h3>Named arguments</h3>
    <p>
      So far we have mostly used the functions like we did in the above example:
      inserting the inputs to the function (which we call arguments or parameters) in the order they are expected.
      There is another very common way for doing this.
      You can directly assign values to the input arguments by their names.
      For better illustration of that try to guess the output of the following code, then try it in Python.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">def subtract(a, b):
  # This is a simple function that subtracts two numbers
  return a - b

# Using function with named arguments
answer = subtract(b=8, a=5)
print(answer)
</code></pre>

    <h3>Default arguments</h3>
    Python allows you to have functions with default values for their arguments.
    This means that you don't have to always provide all the arguments to a function.
    In fact, you have been using these functions since the beginning without knowing it.
    Check the arguments for <span class="inline-code">print</span> function
    <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/print" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <p>
      You can also define your own functions with the default values.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">def subtract(a, b=0):
  # This is a simple function that subtracts two numbers
  # The second number has a default value.
  return a - b

# This is how we use this function.
print(subtract(12))
print(subtract(a=5))
print(subtract(a=5, b=2))
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      12
      <br>
      5
      <br>
      3
    </div>

    <h2>String</h2>
    <p>
      We are familiar with <span class="inline-code">String</span> types from Chapter 1.
      We have used some simple functions from the <span class="inline-code">String</span> objects,
      for example, <span class="inline-code">lower</span> and <span class="inline-code">upper</span>,
      which return the same <span class="inline-code">String</span> with all its characters in <i>lower</i> or
      <i>upper</i> case, respectively.
      We are going to learn more useful functions from the <span class="inline-code">String</span> object here.
    </p>
    <h3>Substring</h3>
    <p>
      To understand many of the functions that work with <span class="inline-code">String</span> objects in Python,
      we first need to know what is a <strong>substring</strong>.
      A substring is a contiguous part of a <span class="inline-code">String</span> that can be a
      <span class="inline-code">String</span> by itself.
      For example, "side" is substring of "re<span style="color: red;">side</span>nce".
      Similarly, "ve ca" is substring of "I ha<span style="color: red;">ve ca</span>ts and they are cute."
      But as far as python knows "new" is NOT a substring of "New providence"
      because for Python "new" and "New" are two different strings.
    </p>
    <h3>String index</h3>
    <p>
      So far we have seen Python strings as a single entity. But in fact each string is like a <i>list</i> of
      characters.
      As any other list, the objects inside it have index (Don't forget that this index starts from 0, not 1).
    </p>
    <img src="../../../images/learn_python/chapter5/StringIndex.png" width="60%" class="image">
    <p>
      Therefore, you can use the same indexing number we used for lists in Python with strings.
      Try figuring out the output of the following code:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># String index
# Indexing for a list
my_list = [2, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(my_list[3])

my_string = "carrots"
print(my_string[5])
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      8
      <br>
      t
    </div>

    <h3><span class="inline-code">count</span></h3>
    <p>
      Use this function for counting the number substring in a Python string.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Using the count function
S = "I can not have an apple."
# This will count the number of "an" substrings in String S
print(S.count("an"))
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      2
    </div>

    <h3><span class="inline-code">find</span></h3>
    This function returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring inside your string,
    if the substring exits. If it doesn't, it returns -1.
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Using the find function
S = "I can not have an apple."
print(S.find("have"))

print(S.find("cat"))
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      10
      <br>
      -1
    </div>

    <h3><span class="inline-code">replace</span></h3>
    <p>
      As the name suggests, this function replace one substring in your string with another.
      Going through the following example will clarify this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Replacing substrings
S = "I have a dog. I think dogs are the best."

# We are creating a new string after replacing the substring
S2 = S.replace("dog", "cat")
print(S2)
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      I have a cat. I think cats are the best.
    </div>

    <h3><span class="inline-code">split</span></h3>
    <p>
      This function is different from all the string object functions we talked about so far.
      It returns a list of strings made from <i>splitting</i> the original substring by some substring.
      If the substring does not exist in the original string, then it returns the original string as single item in the
      returned list.
    </p>
    <img src="../../../images/learn_python/chapter5/split.png" width="60%" class="image">

    <p>
      Pay attention to the following example of how to use the <span class="inline-code">split</span> function.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Splitting the string into a list of its substrings
splitted_parts = "cat, dog , chickens , good,boy".split(",")
print(splitted_parts)
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Notice how we use the string function differently in the example below?
      So far we have been creating a string object first,
      and then calling that with the function that we needed.
      But we don't have to do that; we can directly use any of these functions on a string.
      In fact what happens here is that Python creates an anonymous object for you.
    </p>

    <div class="output-box">
      ['cat', ' dog ', ' chickens ', ' good', 'boy']
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      Sometimes using the <span class="inline-code">split</span>
      function makes left over space before and after the returned strings.
      For example, <span class="inline-code">"Hello, I am here".split(",")</span>
      returns <span class="inline-code">["Hello", " I am here"]</span>.
      As you see, the second string has an extra space in front of it.
      There is a function called <span class="inline-code">strip()</span>
      that returns a string in which the extra spaces,
      before and after the string are removed.
      Think about how you can remove all the extra spaces from the returned strings in the list.
    </div>

    <h3><span class="inline-code">join</span></h3>
    <p>
      This function is the opposite of the <span class="inline-code">split</span> function.
      It <i>joins</i> the strings inside a lists into a single string, by putting another string between them.
      So in summary it turns a list of strings into a single string.
    </p>
    <img src="../../../images/learn_python/chapter5/join.png" width="75%" class="image">
    <p>
      An example of using <span class="inline-code">join</span> function.
      See how we used it in two different ways this time too.
      Once with creating an string and using it for join, and the other time with using a string directly.
      The results are exactly the same. Choose based on your own preference.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># Joining strings

my_animals = ["cats", "dogs", "squirels"]

# method 1
join_string = " are cute. "
print(join_string.join(my_animals))

# method 2
print(" are cute. ".join(my_animals))
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      cats are cute. dogs are cute. squirels
      <br>
      cats are cute. dogs are cute. squirels
    </div>

    <h2>List</h2>
    <p>
      Now let's talk about another important built-in object in Python: <strong>list</strong>.
      We already introduced <span class="inline-code">append</span> and <span class="inline-code">count</span>.
      Remember that the first one adds an element to the end of the string,
      and the latter counts the number of occurrences of an element inside the list.
      Have a quick look at chapter 3 to refresh your mind on these two functions.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># list functions: append and count

my_favorite_numbers = [5, 6, 3, 4]

# append
my_favorite_numbers.append(6)
print("My favorite numbers are", my_favorite_numbers)

# count number 6s in the list
print(my_favorite_numbers.count(6))
</code></pre>
    <div class="output-box">
      My favorite numbers are [5, 6, 3, 4, 6]
      <br>
      2
    </div>

    <h3>Slicing a list</h3>
    <p>
      We know how to get one element from a list.
      But what if we wanted to get some contiguous elements altogether?
      In other words, you wanted to have a new list from the ranges of indexes of your original list.
      This is what we call a <strong>slice</strong> from the original list.
      See the image below for illustration of the slice.
    </p>
    <img src="../../../images/learn_python/chapter5/list_slice.png" width="65%" class="image">
    <p>
      It is import to remember that in Python (as well as many other languages)
      when you have two numbers for the start and the end of your slice, the first one is inclusive
      (meaning the element in that index is part of your slice) and the second one is not.
      And of course, don't forget that we start counting from 0 in computer science.
    </p>

    <div class="box">
      Slices for lists are like substrings for strings.
      Do you see their resemblance?
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      Try writing a function that generates a slice of an array.
      Your function will be something like <span class="inline-code">slice(my_list, start_index, end_index)</span>.
      It returns a new list from elements of <span class="inline-code">my_list</span>,
      from <span class="inline-code">start_index</span> to <span class="inline-code">end_index</span>.
    </div>

    <p>
      If you tried the previous exercise of writing your own slicer function,
      you should know that Python gives you an easier way of doing this.
      It is very similar to when we were getting a single element from our list.
      You just need to use a <span class="inline-code">:</span> symbol between two indexes.
      For example, <span class="inline-code">my_list[3:5]</span> gives you a new list that includes all the items from 3
      to 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your slice starts from the beginning of the list, you don't need to include 0,
      you can just write <span class="inline-code">my_list[:5]</span> in your code.
      Python understands that you want everything in your list up to, but not including the item at index 5.
      Similarly, if you want to your slice to end of your list, you don't need to include the last index.
      Instead of that you can simply write something like <span class="inline-code">my_list[2:]</span>,
      which Python understands as you asking it to make a slice from the item at index 2 all the way to the end of the
      list.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Making different slices

my_favorite_numbers = [5, 6, 3, 4, 13, 23, 17]

# Some middle slice
print(my_favorite_numbers[3:6])

# A slice from the beginning
print(my_favorite_numbers[:5])

# A slice to the end
print(my_favorite_numbers[3:])
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      [4, 13, 23]
      <br>
      [5, 6, 3, 4, 13]
      <br>
      [4, 13, 23, 17]
    </div>

    <h3>Joining two lists</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine you have two lists and want to create another list that contains the two of them.
      In other words, you want to have a new list that is made from adding one of them at the end of the other one.
      This is what we call <strong>concatenation</strong> in computer science.
      You can easily do this by putting a <span class="inline-code">+</span> symbol between two lists.
      This will generate a new list that is made from all the elements in the first list followed by the elements in the
      second.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># concatenating lists

my_numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]
my_other_numbers = [3, 6, 8, 9, 12, 78]

# concatenating two lists
all_my_numbers = my_numbers + my_other_numbers
print(all_my_numbers)
</code></pre>
    <img src="../../../images/learn_python/chapter5/concat.png" width="65%" class="image">

    <div class="output-box">
      [2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 6, 8, 9, 12, 78]
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      Can you write a function that concatenates two lists without using what we introduced here?
      Of course you can. Try it.
    </div>

    <h3><span class="inline-code">pop</span></h3>
    <p>
      With Python <i>popping</i> is the opposite of appending:
      it removes the last element from your list and returns it.
      So, this element is no longer in your lists after it was popped from the list.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># popping from a list

my_numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]

poped_number = my_numbers.pop()
print("The popped number was", poped_number)
print("Your list after popping is", my_numbers)
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      The popped number was 5
      <br>
      Your list after popping is [2, 3, 4]
    </div>

    <h3>Reversing a list</h3>
    <p>
      You can easily reverse the original order of items in your list
      using the <span class="inline-code">reverse</span> function.
      Unlike many other functions we tried before this function does not return a new object (in this case a list).
      Instead, when you call this function on a list object it reorders elements in your list <i>in-place</i>.
      Doing something in-place means that you do not create a new object, instead you change the current one as is.
      If you notice, this function doesn't return anything either.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Reversing items in a list

my_numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]
my_numbers.reverse()
print(my_numbers)
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      [5, 4, 3, 2]
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      Here is another challenge for the braves among us. Write your own function that reverses a list.
      It can receive a list as input, and output another list which is the reversed version of the input.
    </div>

    <h3>Sorting a list</h3>
    <p>
      Sorting a list is putting its items in a order from the lowest to highest.
      In Python you easily do this with any list using the <span class="inline-code">sort</span> function.
      Similar to the <span class="inline-code">reverse</span> function <span class="inline-code">sort</span> is working
      in-place.
      So it does not return a new list, it just rearranges the items around your list.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># Sorting items in a list

my_numbers = [6, 2, 8, 9, 4, 1]
my_numbers.sort()
print(my_numbers)
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9]
    </div>

    <h2>Dictionary</h2>
    <p>
      Time to explore another important built-in object in Python: <strong>dictionary</strong>.
      Remember that dictionaries are very similar to lists.
      Both lists and dictionaries are for keeping a collection of other objects in them.
      Their main difference is that lists are using the <i>index</i> (an integer value) to find objects in them,
      whereas dictionaries use <i>keys</i>.
      Python just counts where your items in your list is and calls it the <i>index</i>,
      but in dictionaries you decide what the key is going to be.
      Here is another reminder of how dictionaries work.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># Dictionaries and keys

game_score = {'Jenny': 6, 'Peter': 3, 'Alice': 4}
print("Jenny's score is", game_score["Jenny"])
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      Jenny's score is 6
    </div>
    <p>
      In this dictionary, named <span class="inline-code">game_score</span>,
      we keep track of the score in an imaginary game.
      Any time we wanted to read or change someone's score, we use that person's name,
      which we defined as the key for our dictionary, to access it.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting the keys and values</h3>
    <p>
      So far we have been interacting with Python dictionaries one item at a time:
      we were either, reading, adding or changing a single element from the dictionary.
      Another important point was that we had to know what were the keys in the dictionary.
      But what if we didn't know that?
      Here is where we need to request for getting the keys or values in the dictionary.
      Luckily Python has built-in functions in its dictionary objects that helps us with that.
    </p>

    <h4><span class="inline-code">keys</span></h4>
    <p>
      This functions returns all the keys in a dictionary.
      The easy way to use the returned values is to run it with a for loop.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># Looping over dictionary keys

game_score = {'Jenny': 6, 'Peter': 3, 'Alice': 4}
for k in game_score.keys():
      print(k)
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      Jenny
      <br>
      Peter
      <br>
      Alice
    </div>

    <h4><span class="inline-code">values</span></h4>
    <p>
      The <span class="inline-code">values</span> function is very similar to the
      <span class="inline-code">keys</span> function.
      But, as the name suggests, it returns the values in the dictionary instead of the keys.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># Looping over dictionary keys

game_score = {'Jenny': 6, 'Peter': 3, 'Alice': 4}
for v in game_score.values():
    print(v)
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      6
      <br>
      3
      <br>
      4
    </div>

    <div class="box">
      The <span class="inline-code">keys</span> and <span class="inline-code">values</span>
      functions return something called and <i>iterator</i>. That is why we used them with loops.
      Talking about iterators is beyond this class.
      But if you wanted to use the returned values of these functions easier,
      you can always turn them into a list.
      For example, <span class="inline-code">list(game_score.keys())</span>
      returns a list with all the keys in the <span class="inline-code">game_score</span> dictionary.
      You can do the exact same thing with the values too.
    </div>

    <h3>Checking if a key is in a dictionary</h3>
    <p>
      If you want to check whether a key already exists in a dictionary or not,
      use the <span class="inline-code">in</span> keyword similar to what you see in the following example.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Checking a key inside a dictionary

game_score = {'Jenny': 6, 'Peter': 3, 'Alice': 4}
if 'Bob' in game_score:
    print("Bob's score is", game_score["Bob"])
else:
    print("Bob does not have a score in this game.")
</code></pre>

    <div class="output-box">
      Bob does not have a score in this game.
    </div>

    <p>
      Fun fact, you can use the <span class="inline-code">in</span> keyword to check the content of lists too.
    </p>
