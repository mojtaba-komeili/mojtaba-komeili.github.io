    <h1>Branches</h1>
    <p>
      Often in a program it happens that the <strong>flow</strong> of your program depends on certain conditions.
      This is where branches come in.
    </p>

    <img src="../../../images/learn_python/chapter2/branches.jpeg" width="60%" class="image">
    <p>
      Branches are also known as the <span class="inline-code">if-else</span> conditions, because that's literally what
      happens in branching:
      A branch is a point in a program where there is a decision to make, based on which the flow of the program will be
      determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine a program that asks for your age and then tells you how old you are
      (not very useful, I know, but bare will me a bit).
      The code for such program will be something like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># A program that tells you how old you are, but asks you that first.
age = input('How old are you? ')
print('You are ' + age + ' years olds.')
print('Have a nice day. Bye!')</code></pre>

    <p>
      Python will read your program line by line and executes each line.
      So, this is how your program <strong>flow</strong> look likes:
    </p>

    <img src="../../../images/learn_python/chapter2/straight-flow.png" width="70%" class="image">

    <h2>Change of flow</h2>
    <p>
      Now let's turn this into a program that does something slightly more useful:
      It asks your age, and then it tells you if you are eligible to vote
      (let's assume the legal age for voting is 18).
      Obviously we need something that has two separate paths.
      One of them tells you "Yes, you are" <i>if</i> the age you typed in is more than 18,
      and the other one that tells you "No, you aren't" otherwise.
    </p>

    <img src="../../../images/learn_python/chapter2/conditioned-flow.png" width="70%" class="image">

    <p>
      As you can see in the image above there are two flows for the program.
      Here is where the <strong>conditional statements</strong> come in.
      Conditional statemenet depend on an <i>statement</i> being <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>.
      In Python, as in other porgramming languages,
      we use the methematical equality and inequality signs to make these statemenets.
      The proper way to read the mathematical expressions made from the above is through using them with this table.
    </p>
    <div>
      <table style="width:50%">
        <tr>
          <th>Symbol</th>
          <th>Meaning</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> == </td>
          <td>Equal</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> != </td>
          <td>NOT Equal</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> > </td>
          <td>Greater than</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> >= </td>
          <td>Greater than or equal</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            < </td>
          <td>Less than</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <= </td>
          <td>Less than or equal</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      For example, we read <span class="inline-code">7 > 32</span> like this: "7 is greater than 32".
      Obviously, this is not correct, whic mean that this statement is <span class="inline-code">False</span>.
      Try this in Python as see if it agrees:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Logical statements in Python
print(7 > 32)</code></pre>

    <h2>Boolean</h2>
    <p>
      Remember the variables that we introdued before?
      There is another VERY important variable type called <strong>boolean</strong>.
      Booleans can only take two values <span class="inline-code">False</span> or <span class="inline-code">True</span>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Boolean values
BooleanValue = True
print(BooleanValue)</code></pre>

    <p>
      As you may imagine there is not much appeal in having boolean variables on their own.
      But their importance becomse clear when we go back to the conditional statements that we talked about.
      In fact, what changes the flow of a program is often a boolean variable being
      <span class="inline-code">False</span> or <span class="inline-code">True</span>.
      Try to see if you can figure out what this code will print:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">B1 = 7 > 9
print(B1)

print(4 != 6)

# Remember the use of brackets from the last lession?
B2 = (7 - (5 * 2)) == ((5 * 3) - 4)
print(B2)

B3 = "Something" == "something"
print(B3)
</code></pre>


    <h2>If condition</h2>
    <p>
      Now it is time to introduce one of our most important concepts in programming: <strong>if blocks</strong>.
      Using keyword <span class="inline-code">if</span> in Python, you will tell your program to run a piece of your
      program
      only <i>if</i> a condition is true. Here is where we use the power of boolean variables.
      Python will look at the boolean variables (or an statement that can have a boolean value) and if it was
      <span class="inline-code">True</span>, it will run the <strong>block of code</strong> after the <span
        class="inline-code">if</span>.
      Otherwise it will ignore the block of code, and continues with the code afetr that block.
    </p>
    <h3>What is a <strong>block of code</strong>?</h3>
    <p>
      A block of code, is any piece of program. It can be a single line of code or a few thousand lines.
      Having separate blocks of code, helps us tell python to run a block or not, depending on a boolean value.
      The first block of code that we are going to work with here is the block of code that belongs to an if branch.
      This is how we use the if condition and its block in Python
      (notice the <span class="inline-code">:</span> after the boolean condition, we always need that):
    </p>
    <img src="../../../images/learn_python/chapter2/if-block.png" width="70%" class="image">
    <p>
      Here we have a boolean statement, that can be <span class="inline-code">True</span> or <span
        class="inline-code">False</span>,
      in front of an <span class="inline-code">if</span>. This is the <span class="inline-code">A > 20</span>.
      Then, right after that there are two lines of code that have <strong>tab</strong> space in front of them.
      All this area with tab in front of it is what we call the <strong>if block</strong>.
      Python will run this code if and only if during running the program the boolean condition in front of <span
        class="inline-code">if</span> was <span class="inline-code">True</span>, otherwise it completely ignore it.
      Knowing this try to predict what happens when we run this program.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happens a lot in programming that we want to run a block of code if something was true,
      and another block of code otherwise. We can have this with 2 separate if blocks that have the opposite if each
      other.
      But, because this is very common, programming langauges already have something for use.
      All we need to do is adding <span class="inline-code">else</span> right after our if block finishes,
      and adding a block of code.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># if block with else condition
a = input('Insert a number: ')
num = int(a)

if a > 20:
  # This is the block of code that will run if the boolean condition was True
  print('Your number was more than 20')
else:
  # This is the block of code that will run if the boolean condition was False
  print('Your number was not more than 20')
</code></pre>

    <div class="box">
      Now you must be ready to write the code for the age checking program we talked about above. Try it!
    </div>

    <h2>Multiple conditions</h2>
    It may also happen that you need to check something for multiple conditions.
    For example, if you want to check if number is between 1-5, or 6-10, or 11-20, etc.
    This may need manye if else branches, or a shorter way in Python is using <span class="inline-code">elif</span>,
    which is short of <i>else if</i>. You can have as many <span class="inline-code">elif</span>s that you want afetr an
    <span class="inline-code">if</span> condition to check for various other things that may happen.
    Remember that each of those need a block of code for its own flow.
    Example:
    <pre><code class="language-python"># if block with else condition
a = input('Insert a number: ')
num = int(a)

if a > 30:
  print('Your number was more than 30')
elif a > 20:
  print('Your number was more than 20')
elif a > 10:
  print('Your number was more than 10')
else:
  print('Your number was less than 10')
</code></pre>

    <div class="box">
      What do you think the output of the following program will be. Try it on your coputer.
    </div>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># What is the output
num = 45

if a > 10:
  print('Your number was more than 10')
elif a > 20:
  print('Your number was more than 20')
elif a > 30:
  print('Your number was more than 30')
</code></pre>

    <h2>Blocks inside blocks</h2>
    So far we have been checking a single condition. But what if our we want to check another condition inside a block?
    You can always have a block inside another block. All you need is an extra <strong>tab</strong>.
    <img src="../../../images/learn_python/chapter2/inner-block.png" width="70%" class="image">

    <div class="box">
      You must be older than 10, and taller than 40" for a roller coaster ride.
      Write a program that asks someone for "age" and "height".
      Then prints out if that person can ride the roller coaster.
    </div>

    <h2>Complex conditions</h2>
    <p>
      If you have tried the roller coaster excersise, you may done it with two blocks (one inside the other).
      But thinking about it logically the only thing that you needed to do was to check if the age was more than 10
      <strong>AND</strong> the height was more than 40.
      Checking multiple conditions like that is very common in programming.
      That's why all the programming languages have <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong> operations beween
      booleans.
      Using these two opraions beween two boolean variable works exactly as they read.
      In Python we use <span class="inline-code">and</span> for AND between two booleans,
      and <span class="inline-code">or</span> for OR between two booleans
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># Operation between booleans
# Check how here we use comments after the main Python command.
# Anything that we add after the # will be ignored by Python

b1 = 45 > 3  # This is True
b2 = "NP" == "New Providence"  # This is False

print(b1 and b2)  # will print False, because only one of them is True
print(b1 or b2)  # will print False, because one of them is true
</code></pre>
    <p>
      In the beginning it may be confusing to know what is the resutls when we have
      <span class="inline-code">and</span>, <span class="inline-code">or</span> between two booleans.
      This table is good guide.
    </p>
    <div>
      <table style="width:50%">
        <tr>
          <th>A</th>
          <th>B</th>
          <th>A and B</th>
          <th>A or B</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> False </td>
          <td> False </td>
          <td> False </td>
          <td> False </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> True </td>
          <td> False </td>
          <td> False </td>
          <td> True </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> False </td>
          <td> True </td>
          <td> False </td>
          <td> True </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> True </td>
          <td> True </td>
          <td> True </td>
          <td> True </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      Now we can easily write our roller coaster check program like this:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># Roller coaster
# Notice the use of one function inside the other
# This puts the output from one function directly inside the other

age = int(input('What is your age? '))
height = int(input('What is your height in inches? '))

# See the use of brackets, remember how we used them in the previous lesson
if (age > 10) and (height > 40):
  print('Enjoy the roller coaster')
else:
  print('Sorry you can not ride')
</code></pre>
    <p>
      As you see in the above example, the brackets around the boolean variables act in the exact same way as they do in
      arithmetic ones.
      So, if there is a complex condition, feel free to use brackets as needed to make sure you get the right
      combination.
      As a practice, see if you can predict the outcomes printed out from this code.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># What do you think the output is?
bv1 = (67 > 45) and ("this" != "that")
bv2 = (((5 * 7) - 45) > 13) or bv1
print(bv1, bv2)
</code></pre>

    <div class="box">
      Consider a college that needs both the following conditions for accepting students.
      <ul>
        <li>GPA > 3.5</li>
        <li>ACT > 25 or SAT > 1200</li>
      </ul>
      Write a program that asks appropriate questions from user and tell him if he can get into this college.
    </div>

    <h1>Loops</h1>
    <img src="../../../images/learn_python/chapter2/loops.jpeg" width="70%" class="image">
    <p>
      We just saw how if blocks are working. They run a block of code <i>once</i>, if some boolean statement/variable
      was true.
      But what if there is a block of code that we want to run more than one time?
      This is in fact a very common thing to have in any program.
      <strong>Loops</strong> are what we use in programming to repeat a block of code multiple times.
      There are many ways to create a loop in a program. Here we focus on <span class="inline-code">while</span> and
      <span class="inline-code">for</span> loops.
    </p>
    <h2>while loop</h2>
    <p>
      A <span class="inline-code">while</span> loop in many ways resembles an <span class="inline-code">if</span>
      conditions.
      The only difference is that Python runs the if block <i>only once</i> if the condition is true.
      But in a while loop the <strong>loop block</strong> keeps repeating as long as the conditions is true.
      See if you can figure out what this while loop doesn.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># A while loop
my_number = 1
while 4 > my_number:
  print(my_number)
  my_number = my_number + 1
</code></pre>

    <div class="box">
      <span style="color:red">DANGER!</span> You MUST alway make sure that the condition that makes loop can be true or
      false.
      One of the biggest pitfalls in programming is having a condition on the loop that is never false.
      This is known as an <strong>infinite loop</strong> and is most common bugs in a code.
      This loops may never end which means that your program never finishes.
      Sometimes the only way to stop a program that has an infintie loop is to turn off your computer.
      But this happens rarely. We usually just have to force close our program.
    </div>
    <p>
      What do you think will happen if you run this program? Run it on your own risk.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># A while loop
my_number = 1
while 4 > my_number:
  print(my_number)
</code></pre>

    <p>
      Here is another example of a program that uses while loop.
      Here when the loop ends depends on the input to program.
      It may take many tries. But still there exist a condition out of it.
      So, we do NOT call this one an infinite loop.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Guessing game
my_number = 43
your_guess = int(input('Guess my number [1-100]: '))
while your_guess != my_number:
  print('You guessed wrong! Try again.')
  # See how we give a new value to the variable your_guess every time.
  your_guess = int(input('Guess my number [1-100]: '))

print('Congratulations, you guessed right. The number was ', my_number)
</code></pre>

    <div class="box">
      Write a better version of the above program (the guessing game) that tells you if your next guess needs to be
      higher or lower.
      For example if the number was 14 and user has guessed 65, the program tells user to go lower.
    </div>

    <h2>for loop</h2>
    <p>
      Another very common loop is the <span class="inline-code">for</span>.
      We doing something with all the elements in a list (remember the lists from the last class?).
      For loop receives a list (to be more accurate an iterable, but don't worry about that, we will be working mostly
      with lists for now)
      and runs the block with each of the element in that list one by one.
      For loops have a variable that will be updated everytime that the loop block runs.
      The following images illustartes how this works.
    </p>
    <img src="../../../images/learn_python/chapter2/expanded-loop.png" width="100%" class="image">

    <div class="box">
      Write a program that uses a loop to write the name of the days in a week and their order.
      For example, "Monday 1" .... "Sunday 7".
    </div>
    <h3>range function</h3>
    <p>
      Time for new python function:
      A very useful function that is regularly used with a for loop is the <span class="inline-code">range</span>.
      For this class we try using it only with a for loop.
      It helps you to generate the list of numbers you need, so you don't have to type them all.
      If you use it with a for loop, it can replace your list of numbers. For example instead of <span
        class="inline-code">[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</span>,
      you may use <span class="inline-code">range(1, 7)</span>. This will give you the list of numbers from 1 up to (but
      not including) 7.
      You can even give a third argument, that will be the increments, defaulat was 1 as you saw before.
      See following examples for better understanding:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># For loops with range

# This will print numbers from 1 to 100
for i in range(1, 101):
  print(i)

# This will print numbers from 5 to 100, with increments of 5
# That is 5, 10, 15, ..., 100
for i in range(5, 101, 5):
  print(i)
</code></pre>
    <div class="box">
      Write a program that outputs the even numbers less than 100, except numbers that are in 50-60 and 78-87 range
      (inclusise).
    </div>

    <h2>Break and continue</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="inline-code">break</span> and <span class="inline-code">continue</span>
      are two keyword to control the flow of the loops. It works both in
      <span class="inline-code">while</span> and <span class="inline-code">for</span> loops.
    </p>

    <h3>Break</h3>
    <p>
      If Python reaches the <span class="inline-code">break</span> keyword in a loop it exits that loop altogether.
      That's why the call it <span class="inline-code">break</span>, because it breaks the loop.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Using break inside the loop.
for i in [2, 3, 4]:
  if i == 3:
    break  # this breaks the loop and goes to the code after the loop
  print(i)
</code></pre>

    <h3>Continue</h3>
    <p>
      If Python reaches the <span class="inline-code">continue</span> keyword in a loop it goes to the top of the loop's
      block.
      Try to predict the output of the following code.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Using continue inside the loop.
for i in [2, 3, 4]:
  if i == 3:
    continue  # this tells Python to go to the top of the loop's block
  print(i)
</code></pre>
    <div class="box">
      <p>
        Find the smallest number after 1000 that can be divided by 23.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hint 1: check numbers larger than 100 to see which one is the first one that can be divided by 17.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hint 2: there is a useful Python operation you can use here.
        <span class="inline-code">%</span> finds the remained between two integers.
        For example <span class="inline-code">12 % 5</span> will be 2,
        because the remainer of dividing 12 by 5 is 2.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <p>
      We have seen and used many functions so far. It's time to see how functions are built, and make some of our own.
      As it was the theme in this lesson, function are (again) a block of code that can run it from anywhere in our
      code.
      We use functions to avoid rewriting the same piece of code over and over.
      To do that, we put a <strong>block</strong> of code inside a function, name that function something,
      and everytime wanted to used it we just simply call that function by its name.
      We use the Python keyword <span class="inline-code">def</span> to <i>define</i> our own functions.
      After <span class="inline-code">def</span> we write the name of the function (the same rules for naming a
      variable)
      and then add <span class="inline-code">()</span> in front of it to say this is a function (we talk about the
      brackets more soon).
      To call the function, just use its name with <span class="inline-code">()</span> in front of it.
      Example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Define a function

# Defining my function
def MyFunction():
  print('This is from my function')

# Running my function
MyFunction()
</code></pre>
    <div class="box">
      Python doesn't run the code in your function definition, until you call the function.
    </div>
    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <p>
      It is really boring to have a function that only does one thing (a one trick function).
      Remember the functions we used so far were all receiving some variables that could change what they were doing
      (<span class="inline-code">range(4, 6)</span> and <span class="inline-code">range(9, 20)</span> do different
      things).
      We call the variables the <strong>arguments</strong> to our function (also sometimes called parameters).
      If you want a function that receives arguments and uses them for its process, all you need to do is to
      add some variables inside the <span class="inline-code">()</span> that you had during the function definition.
      When you call the function with variables, Python will replace them with the arguments of your function
      <strong>in the same order</strong>. See the example below:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Define a function WITH arguments

# Defining my function
def TwoNumberFunction(a, b):
  print('Your first argument was', a)
  print('Your second argument was', b)

# Running my function
TwoNumberFunction(54, "Library")
</code></pre>

    <div class="box">
      Write a program that receives two numbers and tells you whihc one was bigger.
    </div>

    <h2>Returned values</h2>
    <p>
      Functions we used so far receive arguments and print something on the screen.
      We often use function to run some code and then give us some answer.
      Or technically speaking <strong>return</strong> a value.
      (remember how <span class="inline-code">range</span> function <i>returns</i> something that we use as a list).
      See how the following function returns the results of multiplying two numbers.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># Multiply function

# Defining the function
def Multiply(a, b):
  return a * b

# Usingt the function
r = Multiply(4, 6)
print(r)
</code></pre>

    <p>
      When a function reaches the <span class="inline-code">return</span> line in its code,
      it returns from that function and does not continue from that point one.
      Can you tell the output of this program?
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">def MyFunc(a, b):
  c = a + b
  return c
  c = 7
  return c

r = MyFunc(4, 6)
print(r)
</code></pre>

    <div class="box">
      Write a program that finds the smallest number that its division by 13 is more than 5 and its division by 17 is
      more than 6.
      Hint: use a function that counts from the bottom and returns as soon as it reaches these conditions.

      <li>
        Imagine the cost of tomato per pound is $2 if you are buying less than 5 lb, $1.5 for more than 5 up to 20 lb,
        and $1 for more.
        Write a program that asks for how much tomato someone has purchased and tells you how much it costs.

        Write a program that tells you who is the winner in rock/paper/scissors game.
        It asks for the move from each player (let's assume 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, ans 's' for scissors)
        and tells your who is the winner.

        Write a program that prints out all the prime numbers that are less 100.
        Don't forget to write a code that checks if a number is prime or not.
