      <strong>NOTE</strong>: If you have not tried the project in the previous chapter,
      please try it before continuing the rest of this chapter.
      You need to at least know the
      <a href="https://mojtaba-komeili.github.io/learn_python/chapter3_game">game</a>.
    </div>
    <p>
      Having tried to build our simple game, you might have noticed that perhpas the hardest part was
      planning the functions that you need and how to connect pieces of your code.
      This is always a critical step in programming,
      and becomes extraordinarily hard for larger and more complext programs.
      A very interesting approach in programming that helps us think better about our programs
      and build them easier is called <strong>Object Oriented Porgramming</strong>.
      In this chapter we see how we can build our game a lot easier with objects that we are building <i>and</i>
      even use some objects that are built by others.
    </p>
    <h2>Think Objects</h2>
    <p>
      What is an object? Objects in programming are very similar to objects we have in real world.
      We define each object with a set of two thigns:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Properties</strong>: how it is and looks like. For example color, size, location, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Actions</strong>: what it can do. For example runs, moves, eats, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box">
      Find an object around you and try to find its <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>actions</strong>.
    </div>

    <h3>Building a car object</h3>
    <p>
      Let's imagine a car. If you wanted to define a car in your program as an object,
      what do you think the <strong>properties</strong> and <strong>actions</strong> for a car would be?
      Of course there are thousands of things that a car can do (move, stop, turn, play music, heat up seats, etc.)
      and plenty of properties a car has (color, make, number of bolts, amount of gas, etc.).
      But the important thing to remember for bringing it as an object to your program is
      <strong>which of those thousands of properties and actions are what you need in your program.</strong>
      You only need to choose the ones that your program needs. We will talk a bit more about that in a bit.
      For example, for a simple program, your car objects may only need these:
    <ul>
      <li>Properties:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>make</li>
        <li>color</li>
        <li>speed</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Actions:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>accelerate</li>
        <li>brake</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    For showing this easier programmers usually use images like this.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter3/car_uml.png" width="50%" class="image">
    <div class="box">
      This is only one possible design for the objects in the game.
      We may see other alternative ones here, and you may have a different solution of your own.
    </div>
    <p>
      Now try to figure out the objects that we need for our simple game and properties and actions that they have.
      Two objects that we definitely need are our game <strong>hero</strong> and <strong>demon</strong>.
      Using the same diagrams we used for the car, we can have these for our hero and demon character,
      when we are building them into objects in our program.

    <!-- Objects in Python -->
    <h2>Objects in python</h2>

    <!-- Classes -->
    <h3>Class</h3>
    <p>
      <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter3/car_blueprint.png" width="70%" class="image">
      Python uses <strong>classes</strong> to create an object.
      A class is like a blueprint to create something. You give this blueprint to Python and it creates an objects for
      you
      exactly as you asked.
      For example, this is how we define a car class that has a single action, move, in Python.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Defining a car class in Python
class Car:
  def move(self):
    print('The car is moving.')
</code></pre>
    <p>
      In this code we have <span class="inline-code">class Car</span> which tells Python we are about to define a class.
      The block of code (remember tabs) that comes after this line is the definition of this class.
      In this block we have a function called <span class="inline-code">move</span>.
      It is a simple function that just prints "The car is moving.".
      Functions that define actions for an objects <strong>MUST</strong> have <span class="inline-code">self</span> as
      their first parameter.
      It is very important that you remember this.
    </p>

    <!-- Objects -->
    <h3>Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Now that we have a class, we can use it to create and object.
      In other words, now that we told Python how our <span class="inline-code">Car</span> object looks like,
      we are going to tell python to create one for us.
      You can simply create an object from you class by callig your class like a function: <span
        class="inline-code">my_car = Car()</span>.
      <strong>The variable that this returns</strong>, <span class="inline-code">my_car</span>, <strong>is your
        object</strong>.
      Now, you can call actions (functions) from your object by using a "." after your object and then the name of the
      action you want.
      When calling the functions from an object, Python will put the value of <span class="inline-code">self</span>
      inside your function;
      you should <strong>NOT</strong> do it yourself.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Calling actions/functions from an object.
class Car:
  def move(self):
    print('The car is moving.')

# Creating an object using Car class and storing it in a variable
my_car = Car()
# Now we have an object called my_car

# Calling the move function from my_car object
my_car.move()
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Save a file, for example name it <i>cars.py</i>,
      with the code on your file and run it. This will be the output when you run this Python code:
    </p>
    <div class="output-box">
      The car is moving.
    </div>

    <!-- init function -->
    <h3>The <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function</h3>
    <p>
      The most important function in every object is its <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function.
      Every class in Pyhton has an <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function.
      If you don't add it yourself, like we did with the car class here, Python will add that for you when it runs your
      code.
      You saw that when you want to create an object you call its class name,
      for example <span class="inline-code">my_car = Car()</span> to create a
      <span class="inline-code">my_car</span> object from the <span class="inline-code">Car</span> class.
      When Python is creating your object, it first runs the <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function for its
      class.
      In fact, we call this function <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> which is the short form for
      <strong>initialize</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the times Python programmers use <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function to add properties to
      their objects.
      Think about it this way: <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function is where you tell Python how your
      object is
      going to look like right after it was created. Properties in an object are like variables but we put a
      <span class="inline-code">self.</span> in front of their names to say that they belong to that object.
      For example, this is how we make a <i>red ford</i> car object in Python.
      As you can see it also has the <span class="inline-code">move</span> function.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Defining a Red Ford car object
class Car:
  def __init__(self):
    self.make = 'Ford'
    self.color = 'red'

  def move(self):
    print('The car is moving.')
</code></pre>

    <p>
      The properties of an obejct are like any other variable. But you <stron>MUST</stron> have the object name in front
      of them.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Properties of an object
class Car:
  def __init__(self):
    self.make = 'Ford'
    self.color = 'red'

  def move(self):
    print('The car is moving.')
  
my_car = Car()
print('My car is made by ' + my_car.make)
print('The color of my car is ' + my_car.color)
</code></pre>
    <p>And the output of this is</p>
    <div class="output-box">
      My car is made by Ford
      <br>
      The color of my car is red
    </div>

    <p>
      So far our <span class="inline-code">Car</span> class has been always creating one type of car: red Ford.
      But how do we make it to create other types of cars? The answer is usign the <span
        class="inline-code">__init__</span> function.
      As we said, <span class="inline-code">__init__</span> function is just a function that belongs to our object.
      Its first variable is <span class="inline-code">self</span> (which we don't usually thouch), but we can have other
      variables to it.
      For example
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Properties of an object
class Car:
  def __init__(self, make, color):
    self.make = make
    self.color = color

    # Finding out the country it was made baseon on its maker.
    if make == 'Ford' or make == 'GM':
      self.made_in = 'US'
    elif make == 'Honda' or make == 'Toyota':
      self.made_in = 'Japan'
    elif make == 'BMW':
      self.made_in = 'Germany'
    else:
      self.made_in = '???'

  def move(self):
    print('The car is moving.')
  
# Creating an object for my car
my_car = Car('Ford', 'red')
print('My car is made by ' + my_car.make)
print('The color of my car is ' + my_car.color)
print('My car is made in ' + my_car.made_in)

print('---------')

# Creating an object for your car
your_car = Car('Honda', 'black')
print('Your car is made by ' + your_car.make)
print('The color of your car is ' + your_car.color)
print('Your car is made in ' + your_car.made_in)
</code></pre>
    <div class="output-box">
      My car is made by Ford
      <br>
      The color of my car is red
      <br>
      My car is made in US
      <br>
      ---------
      <br>
      Your car is made by Honda
      <br>
      The color of your car is black
      <br>
      Your car is made in Japan
    </div>

    <p>
      You can also read and change the values of the properties from inside the functions of a class.
      Just do not forget that you need to have <span class="inline-code">self.</span> in front of the
      variables that keep the properties of an object.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># A car that accelerates and brakes.
class Car:
  def __init__(self):
    # We set the initial speed to 0
    # because the car was just created and doesn't move.
    self.speed = 0

  def accelerate(self):
    self.speed = self.speed + 1
    print('Car accelerated to the new speed ', self.speed)
  
  def brake(self):
    if self.speed < 1:
      print('The car has stopped. No more braking.')
    else:
      self.speed = self.speed - 1
      print('Car reduced its speed to ', self.speed)

some_car = Car()

      <br>
      The car has stopped. No more braking.
    </div>

    <!-- Nested objects -->
    <h3>Objects inside other objects</h3>
    <p>
      The properties of class can be other objects too.
      Just don't forget that each time you want to use the properties of an object you need to add a ".".
      For example:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Having a car and a truck
class Car:
  def __init__(self, make):
    self.make = make

class Parking:
  def __init__(self, car):
    # See the name of the object property doesn't have to be the same as function argument
    # The property variable name is "car_in_parking" but function argument name is "car"
    self.car_in_parking = car
      
my_car = Car('Ford')
my_parking = Parking(my_car)

print("The car in my parking is made by ", my_parking.car_in_parking.make)

new_car = Car('Honda')
# Chaning the car in the parking
my_parking.car_in_parking = new_car
print("The new car in my parking is made by ", my_parking.car_in_parking.make)
</code></pre>
    <div class="output-box">
      The car in my parking is made by Ford
      <br>
      The new car in my parking is made by Honda
    </div>

    <!-- Inheritance -->
    <h2>Inheritance: how not to repeat the code.</h2>
    <p>
      Let's imagine you wanted to also have a <i>Truck</i> class that creates an objects of type truck for you.
      Your truck object is going to have everything that car did <i>plus it can carry load</i>.
      One way of doing it is like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Having a car and a truck
class Car:
  def __init__(self, make, color):
    self.make = make
    self.color = color
    self.speed = 0

  def move(self):
    print('The car is moving.')

  def accelerate(self):
    self.speed = self.speed + 1
    print('Accelerated to the new speed ', self.speed)
  
  def brake(self):
    if self.speed < 1:
      print('Stopped. No more braking.')
    else:
      self.speed = self.speed - 1
      print('Reduced speed to ', self.speed)


class Truck:
  def __init__(self, make, color):
    self.make = make
    self.color = color
    self.speed = 0

  def move(self):
    print('The truck is moving.')

  def accelerate(self):
    self.speed = self.speed + 1
    print('Accelerated to the new speed ', self.speed)
  
  def brake(self):
    if self.speed < 1:
      print('Stopped. No more braking.')
    else:
      self.speed = self.speed - 1
      print('Reduced speed to ', self.speed)

  def carry_load(self):
    print('The truck is carrying load')


my_car = Car('frod', 'red')
my_truck = Truck('GM', 'blue')
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Here we have exactly repeated three functions
      (<span class="inline-code">__init__</span>, <span class="inline-code">accelerate</span>, <span
        class="inline-code">brake</span>).
      Once for <span class="inline-code">Car</span> class and another time for <span class="inline-code">Truck</span>
      class.
      There is a simple way to avoid this in programming,
      and it is by having two or more obejcts be a <strong>child</strong> of some other object.
      If an object is the child of another object, it means that it can use all the functions and properties of its
      parent.
      For example, we know that car and truck are both vehicles, so we can have another class called <span
        class="inline-code">Vehicle</span>.
      By putting everything that they have in common in the <span class="inline-code">Vehilce</span> class,
      and making sure that both <span class="inline-code">Car</span> and <span class="inline-code">Truck</span>
      are children classes of the <span class="inline-code">Vehilce</span>, we don't have to repeat them.
      The class digarams for <span class="inline-code">Car</span> and <span class="inline-code">Truck</span> classes
      looks like the left image below.
      Compare that to the same calsses without using inheritance on the right to see ho much we are reducing our
      repeated code.
    </p>
    <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter3/car_inheritance.png" width="75%" class="image">
    <p>
      In the above diagram, the <span class="inline-code">Car</span> and <span class="inline-code">Truck</span>
      objects on left side and right side are technically the same.
      The only difference is that objects on the right side are inheriting most of their properties and actions
      from their parent class, which is <span class="inline-code">Vehicle</span>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># Having a car and a truck

class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, make, color):
    self.make = make
    self.color = color
    self.speed = 0

  def accelerate(self):
    self.speed = self.speed + 1
    print('Accelerated to the new speed ', self.speed)
  
  def brake(self):
    if self.speed < 1:
      print('Stopped. No more braking.')
    else:
    self.speed = self.speed - 1
    print('Reduced speed to ', self.speed)

  def move(self):

class Truck(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print('The truck is moving.')

  def carry_load(self):
    print('The truck is carrying load')


my_car = Car()
my_truck = Truck()
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Here we used <span class="inline-code">Car(Vehicle)</span> and <span class="inline-code">Truck(Vehicle)</span>
      instead of just <span class="inline-code">Car</span> and <span class="inline-code">Truck</span>.
      By adding the extra <span class="inline-code">(Vehicle)</span> in front of the class name,
      we are telling Python that this class that we are defining is a child of the <span
        class="inline-code">Vehicle</span> class.
      So, it <strong>inherits</strong> all the propertis and action/functions that already exists in the
      <span class="inline-code">Vehicle</span> class, and we don't have to define them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that <span class="inline-code">Car(Vehicle)</span> and <span class="inline-code">Truck(Vehicle)</span>
      each have a function called <span class="inline-code">move</span> that is different between them.
      We cannot have this function in the <span class="inline-code">Vehicle</span> class, because it is different
      between
      <span class="inline-code">Car(Vehicle)</span> and <span class="inline-code">Truck(Vehicle)</span>.
      Also, as we said earlier <span class="inline-code">Truck(Vehicle)</span> has the extra <span
        class="inline-code">carry_load</span> function.
      Only objects that are made with this new <span class="inline-code">Truck(Vehicle)</span> class can call this
      function, not the <span class="inline-code">Car(Vehicle)</span> or even <span class="inline-code">Vehicle</span>
      objects.
    </p>


    <!-- Modules -->
    <h2>Importing Modules</h2>
    <p>
      Large programs may have thousands of classes. It is really hard to keep them all in the same file.
      Here is when we build <strong>modules</strong>.
      In simple terms, the code that you have inside your file is a module.
      When you see your code is getting too large, or it is hard to keep it all in a single file,
      you can separate it into modules, and save your code in different files.
      When you want to use what you already have in another file in your current code,
      you use <span class="inline-code">import</span>. It makes more sense with the next example:
    </p>
    <p>
      Create two files in the same directory, like the image you see below.
      Here, I am going to keep my classes inside the <i>transportation.py</i> file,
      and use <i>main.py</i> as my main file that I am writting my main code in.

    </p>
    <img src="../images/learn_python/chapter3/two_files.png" width="70%" class="image">

    <div class="box">
      <strong>NOTE</strong>: check the files that each of the following codes goes into from the comment in its first
      line.
    </div>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># This is the transportation.py file
class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, make, color):
    self.make = make
    self.color = color
    self.speed = 0

class Car(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print('The car is moving.')

class Truck(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print('The truck is moving.')

  def carry_load(self):
    print('The truck is carrying load')
</code></pre>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># This is the main.py file

# It tells Python that we are going to use what's inside this file
import transportation

# We are using the Car class define inside the transportation file
my_car = transportation.Car('Ford', 'red')
print('My car is made by ', my_car.make)
print('The color of my car is ', my_car.color)
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now if you run the <i>main.py</i> file (<span class="inline-code">python main.py</span>) you see this output.
    </p>
    <div class="output-box">
      My car is made by Ford
      <br>
      The color of my car is red
    </div>
    <p>
      When you ran <i>main.py</i>, Python opened up the <i>transportation.py</i> file,
      because you imported it, and now you could access it in your <i>main.py</i> file by <span
        class="inline-code">transportation.</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This works also with functions that you have in other files.
      Now, imagine you have two files again. One is called <strong>main.py</strong> and the other one
      <strong>function_module.py</strong>.
      See the code that we have in these two files below.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># This is the function_module.py file

def MyFunction():
  print('Hello from another module.')
</code></pre>

    <pre><code class="language-python"># This is the main.py file

# Importing the module that has our function in it
import function_module

function_module.MyFunction()
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Here we use the <span class="inline-code">MyFunction</span> from <strong>function_module.py</strong> file/module
      inside our code that is in <strong>main.py</strong> file.
      All we need to do is to first import the <strong>function_module.py</strong> file by using <span
        class="inline-code">import function_module</span>,
      and then calling the <span class="inline-code">MyFunction</span> by adding the name of that module and then a "."
      in front of it (see the code above).
      This will be what you see if you run <strong>main.py</strong> code.

    <!-- Python Standard Library -->
    <h3>Python Standard Library</h3>
    <p>
      There are some modules that python has creatd for you and know where they are.
      So, you can import them and use them directly.
      These modules are made to make it easier for you to program your code, and don't have to rewrite everything by
      yourself.
      These moduels are known as Python <strong>Python Standard Library</strong>.
      There are many modules you can use in the standard library. Here we are introducint two important ones.
    </p>
    <h4><span class="inline-code">math</span> module</h4>
    <p>
      Python <strong>math</strong> module has a large number of functions that are used in Mathematics.
      For a full list of all of them see <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html">this page</a>.
      Here are some of the simple ones:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># This tells python that we are using the math module
import math

# math.sqrt finds square root of a number
print('Square root of 64 is ', math.sqrt(64))
print('Square root of 5 is ', math.sqrt(5))

# math.factorial finds the factorial of a number
# The factorial of a number is that number multiplied
# all the positive natural numbers smaller than it. For example:
# Factorial of 5 is   5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
print('Factorial of 7 is', math.factorial(4))
</code></pre>
    <div class="output-box">
      Square root of 64 is 8.0
      <br>
      Square root of 5 is 2.23606797749979
      <br>
      Factorial of 7 is 24
    </div>

    <h4><span class="inline-code">random</span> module</h4>
    <p>
      This module helps you generate random numbers. We need random numbers in programs such as games (hint hint 😜).
      Using this module helps you build things such as rolling a die in a game.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># This tells python that we are using the random module
import random

# math.randint gives you random number between two numbers
# This is how we role a die in Python
number = random.randint(1, 6)
print('You rolled ', number)
</code></pre>
    <p>This is my output for the above code. Remember yours might be different.</p>

      OK, now with everything that we have learned so far. We can redesign our game uing objects?
      Try to figure out what properties and actions your objects need.
      Then see how you are going to organize your code into modules.
      I have a possible solution that you checke by clicking the solution link below.
      But try not to cheat and do your best to have your own solution, then check the one here.

    <!-- Everything is an object -->
    <h2>Everything is an object in Python</h2>
    <p>
      Even if you did not know it, you have been working with objects from the first day of this class.
      All the variables (float, int, list, dictionary, string) were objects.
      This means that many of these objects already had actions/functions we could use.
      Here are some of the interesting methods for variables you have worked with so far.
    </p>


    <!-- List obeject -->
    <h3>List</h3>
    <!-- Append -->
    <h4>Adding something at the end of a list</h4>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># 'append' will add something to the end of a list
myList = [4, 5]
myList.append(7)
print(myList)
</code></pre>
    <div class="output-box">
      [4, 5, 7]
    </div>

    <!-- Count -->
    <h4>Counting number of items in a list</h4>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># 'count' will count how many of an item is in your list
myList = [4, 3, 5, 3, 8, 3, 2, 3, 9, 3]
print(myList.count(3))
print(myList.count(8))
</code></pre>
    <div class="output-box">
      5
      <br>
      1
    </div>


    <!-- String obeject -->
    <h3>String</h3>
    <!-- Upper and lower -->
    <h4>Changing the capitalization</h4>
    <pre><code class="language-python"># 'upper' and 'lower' functions will return the upper or lower case of your string
myString = "New Providence"

lower_string = myString.lower()
print(lower_string)

upper_string = myString.upper()
print(upper_string)
</code></pre>
    <div class="output-box">
